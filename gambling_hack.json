For a short time, it looks like this website redirected to shady gambling websites. The long and short of it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This website used to be on GitHub pages</li>\n<li>The repository was private</li>\n<li>I didn't renew my GitHub Pro (girl,,, the boycott) <sup>1</sup></li>\n<li>Hosting GitHub pages from private repos is a Pro feature</li>\n<li>Once my GitHub pages expired, some third party used my domain (with DNS pointing at GitHub pages), and verified their shady website</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is all now resolved! I explored some other options with similar CI/CD options to GitHub pages, but, frankly the easy option was use my VPS with nginx installed, and then ssh'ing in whenever I need to update.</p>\n<p>Silver lining: this should make deployments instant (something that wasn't always the case about GH Pages!!), and, reduces my dependency on GitHub! It also serves as a good reminder I have a blog, and, is a great reminder to setup downtime monitoring.</p>\n<p>Big shoutout to <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/slimelia.uk\">@slimelia.uk</a> for shooting me a DM alerting me to this - I probably wouldn't have noticed for a while!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>[1.] yes, i still use GitHub Free for public projects - unfortunately it's tricky to exist <em>without</em> it in tech right now. for private personal projects, I'm starting to move things across to a personal Forgejo instance... very slowly.</p>\n","errors":0}
