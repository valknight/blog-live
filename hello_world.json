Cohost no longer exists 💔, and, I don't particularly want to use software or a platform owned by Matt Mullenwegg <sup><a href=\"#references\">1</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#references\">2</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#references\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>My first thought was to go back to Hugo - I absolutely know I was using it wrong (with a wacky build script that I ran locally, that then <code>git push --force</code>'d itself onto a second GitHub repo) - but, I figured I should go the rite of passage, and just built my own static site generator.</p>\n<p>So! That's what this is running on. It's a dotnet tool, with the bulk of the work done by the amazing library <code>Markdig</code><sup><a href=\"#references\">4</a></sup> to parse Markdown, and good ol' <code>HTML Agility Pack</code> <sup><a href=\"#references\">5</a></sup> to handle templating.</p>\n<p>Combined with a script called by <code>entr</code><sup><a href=\"#references\">6</a></sup>` and VS Code's Live preview plugin, I have a pretty neat &quot;write markdown on the left, see live preview update on the right&quot;.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-handle-markdown-code-formatting\">How do I handle markdown &amp; code-formatting?</h2>\n<p><code>Markdig</code> is excellent, and, so are it's plugins for code highlighting. I'm using <code>Markdown.ColorCode</code> <sup><a href=\"#references\">7</a></sup>, which has been painless - apart from one quirk in how the CSS mode handles recognised languages, vs. raw codeblocks. For context, I'm using <code>Markdown.ColorCode</code> in <code>css</code> mode, so I can setup styling in individual CSS files.</p>\n<p>My main issue is I was struggling to find a way to target <em>all</em> codeblocks by my CSS - and not just by language.</p>\n<pre><code>This is a default code block - it's not targettable with a generic class\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"csharp\"><pre>\n<span class=\"comment\">// However, this will instead be easily targettable with &lt;div class=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;</span>\n</pre></div>\n<p>The workaround is the wonderful, fairly new <code>:has</code> CSS selector - specifically, using the following rule:</p>\n<div class=\"css\"><pre>\n<span class=\"comment\">/* languages are because languages are &lt;div class=&quot;language-name&quot;&gt;\n/* if not recognised, it defaults back to &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; */</span>\npre:has(code),<span class=\"cssSelector\"> .csharp</span>, <span class=\"cssSelector\">.python</span>, <span class=\"cssSelector\">.css </span>{\n    <span class=\"cssPropertyName\">foo</span>: <span class=\"cssPropertyValue\">bar</span>;\n}\n</pre></div>\n<pre><code>This block is using the ```generic language workaround.\nIt's... fine, although I wish it was slightly nicer.\n</code></pre>\n<p>I need to have a deeper dig into how Markdig works, and if there's either something else I can use - or, how hard it is for me to roll my own solution here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-the-writing-experience-like\">What's the writing experience like?</h2>\n<p>Pretty pleasant! Majortiy of the time, you're writing markdown - so all the good and bad that comes with that.  For the actual preview of how it looks on a site - <code>entr</code> is invoking a build script whenever I save a file.</p>\n<p>For metadata - I'm using a method I don't love, but, it does work. Theoretically, I parse &quot;tags&quot;, but I currently don't put these anywhere - that's a later problem 😄. When there's an issue with metadata, I also flag this up in the CLI output, so I can easily spot this.</p>\n<p>As for the CLI output - I have these nice tables, thanks to <code>Spectre.Console</code> <sup><a href=\"#references\">8</a></sup>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"assets/images/hello_world_terminal_output.webp\" alt=\"Screenshot of terminal output\" /></p>\n<p>Spectre is a great <code>Rich</code>-inspired dotnet library for console output, and I can't recommend it enough. I only really needed to provide a few helpers around it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>DefaultTable</code> for use between both steps to ensure consistent styling</li>\n<li><code>DefaultTableReport</code> which adds a row, and calls <code>ctx.Refresh</code></li>\n<li><code>FormatPathWithOpen</code> - this presents a path, with a clickable <b>Open</b> button next to it, which opens the file in the associated application</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"csharp\"><pre>\n<span class=\"keyword\">var</span> table = TUIHelpers.DefaultTable(<span class=\"string\">&quot;HTML Generator&quot;</span>);\n<span class=\"keyword\">await</span> AnsiConsole.Live(table)\n    .Overflow(VerticalOverflow.Visible)\n    .Cropping(VerticalOverflowCropping.Top)\n    .StartAsync(<span class=\"keyword\">async</span> ctx =&gt;\n    {\n        <span class=\"comment\">/* some generation stuff here */</span>\n        TUIHelpers.DefaultTableReport(\n            table,\n            ctx,\n            <span class=\"string\">&quot;post name&quot;</span>,\n            <span class=\"string\">&quot;post path&quot;</span>,\n            TUIHelpers.FormatPathWithOpen(<span class=\"string\">&quot;output path&quot;</span>),\n            <span class=\"string\">&quot;[green]OK[/]&quot;</span>,\n            profiler.GetMs()\n        );\n    });\n</pre></div>\n<p>The <em><strong>Open</strong></em> button is very handy for opening up pages, and I'm going to take advantage of this for <em>so</em> many future projects 😆.</p>\n<p>For future work on this - I'd love for this to be just something I can wrap in a using block - e.g:</p>\n<div class=\"csharp\"><pre>\n<span class=\"keyword\">using</span> (<span class=\"keyword\">var</span> table = <span class=\"keyword\">new</span> DefaultTable(<span class=\"string\">&quot;HTML Generator&quot;</span>))\n{\n    table.Report(<span class=\"string\">&quot;post name&quot;</span>, <span class=\"string\">&quot;post path&quot;</span>, <span class=\"comment\">/* etc etc */</span>);\n}\n</pre></div>\n<p>This should be doable with a bit of massaging - I just need to have a little think about how I want to do this 😅, and it's not really a priority.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-else-will-go-here\">What else will go here?</h2>\n<p>Interesting things! At least, that's the hope. I'm currently about to start doing <a href=\"https://itch.io/jam/procjam\">PROCJAM 2024</a>, and I should have something interesting here once that's done. Apart from that, I want to port Unity to SVG out of Cohost land - because I think it's a cool demo, and I fear it's going to die once Cohost starts redirecting to archival.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/22/tumblr-ceo-publicly-spars-with-trans-user-over-account-ban-revealing-private-account-names-in-the-process/\">Tumblr CEO publicly spars with trans user over account ban, revealing private account names in the process</a>, Amanda Silberling, 22-02-2024</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.404media.co/automattic-buyout-offer-wordpress-matt-mullenweg/\">Employees Describe an Environment of Paranoia and Fear Inside Automattic Over WordPress Chaos</a>, Samantha Cole, 17-10-2024</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24260158/automattic-demand-wp-engine-revenue-wordpress-battle\">Automattic demanded a cut of WP Engine’s revenue before starting WordPress battle</a>, Emma Roth, 02-10-2024</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/xoofx/markdig\">Markdig</a>, Alexandre Mutel</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/zzzprojects/html-agility-pack\">HTML Agility Pack</a>, ZZZ Projects</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/eradman/entr\">Entr</a>, Eric Radman</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/wbaldoumas/markdown-colorcode\">Markdown.ColorCode</a>, Will Baldoumas</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console\">Spectre.Console</a>, Patrik Svensson, Phil Scott, Nils Andresen</li>\n</ol>\n","errors":0}
